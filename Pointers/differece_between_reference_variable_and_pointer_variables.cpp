//defferece between pointer variable and reference variables 
//1) A pointer variable can initialised to null BUT a reference variable cannot
//2) A pointer variable stores the address of another variable, and has its own memory address, BUT on the other hand a reference variable just refers to a variable and has same memory address to that of variable it refers
//3) Once a reference variable refers to a variable, it can not be re assigned to another variable BUT a pointer variable can refer to any number of variables
//4) A pointer variable  need to derefer (to get the value) to get the value it stores, BUT on the other hand, a reference variable need not to derefer(reference variable does not take memory of it's own)

/*	                               TEMPLATES IN C++
	->Templates are the powerful features of C++ which allow us to write GENERIC PROGRAMMING

	->In simple words templates allow us to create a single function of a class which can word with different 
	data_types
	
	->Templates are of two types
	1)function templates
	2)class templates
	
	FUNCTION TEMPLATES
	->A function templates works in a similar way, like normal functions but there is one key difference, a normal
	function can work on a single data_type, but a template function can work on different data_type

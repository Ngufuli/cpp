	                    CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTORS IN INHERITENCE
	CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTORS WITHOUT ANY PARAMETERS, in base class and derived class
	
	In this case when we create object of derived class, the base class constructor is called first followed by
	derived class
	
	But the destructors are called in reverse order
	It means the derived class destructor is called first followed by base class destructor
